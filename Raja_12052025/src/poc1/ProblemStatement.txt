Bank Account Simulation with Variable Shadowing and Static Variables

Description:
------------
Create a Java class BankAccount that simulates multiple user accounts using instance variables and static variables.
The class should:
Use static variables to track the total number of accounts and total money in the bank.
Use instance variables for account number and balance.
Demonstrate variable shadowing where a method parameter has the same name as a class variable.
Include deposit, withdraw, and transfer methods.
Show how the variable values change with each operation.
Objective: Understand static vs. instance variables, variable shadowing, and the effect of operations on them.
