Game Score Tracker using Global, Local, and Final Variables

Description:
-------------
Create a Java class GameTracker to track a player's score.
Use global variables for player name and score.
Inside a method, use a local variable with the same name as the global one to simulate a temporary override.
Use a final variable to represent the maximum level of the game.
Provide methods to increase score, level up, and reset score.
Objective: Practice scoping rules, variable shadowing, and use of final for constants.
