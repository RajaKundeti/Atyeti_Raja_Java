Student Grade Calculator using Array Variables and Dynamic Input

Description:
-------------
Design a program that:
Accepts names and marks of n students.
Stores them in appropriate data structures.
Uses variables to dynamically compute and store
the highest scorer, lowest scorer, and class average.
All data should be stored and updated through methods using local and instance variables properly.
Objective: Explore use of arrays with variables, variable updates inside loops, and method-level scoping.
