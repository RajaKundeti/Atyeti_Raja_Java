Income Tax Slab Calculator
Develop a program that calculates income tax for an individual
based on the following slab system:
- Income <= 2.5L: No tax
- 2.5L < Income <= 5L: 5%
- 5L < Income <= 10L: 20%
- Income > 10L: 30%
Use nested if-else statements, arithmetic operators for slab-wise tax calculation,
and display the total tax.
